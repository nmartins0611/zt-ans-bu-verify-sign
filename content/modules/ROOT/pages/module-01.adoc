= Lab Guide: Understanding the Environment


_An introduction to the lab environment setup for collection signing and verification._

---

== Introduction

It's important to understand the lab environment before starting the challenges. In this lab, you will see three main tabs:

* **`Terminal`**: This is where you will run commands to set up and sign an Ansible project using `ansible-sign`.
* **`Automation-Controller`**: This is the web UI for the automation controller, which you will use to verify content.
* **`Gitea`**: This is a lightweight code hosting solution that will host your Ansible project.

== Lab Artifacts

The `ansible-sign` CLI tool is already installed on this system. If you run the `ls` command in the `Terminal` tab, you will find one existing artifact:

* **`ansible-sign-demo`**: This is an empty directory that will hold your playbooks. The contents of this repository will be signed using the `ansible-sign` tool in later challenges.

You will create more artifacts as you progress through the lab, and they will be explained as you go.
